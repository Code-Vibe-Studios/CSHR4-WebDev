### If Statements
1. Write a JavaScript code snippet that checks if a number stored in a variable `num` is greater than 10. If it is, print "Number is greater than 10" to the console.
2. Modify the previous code to also check if the number is equal to 10. Print "Number is exactly 10" if it is.

### If-Else Statements
1. Write a JavaScript function that takes a number as an argument and returns "Positive" if the number is greater than 0, otherwise returns "Non-positive".
2. Create a JavaScript program that checks the age of a person stored in a variable `age`. If the age is 18 or more, print "You are an adult"; otherwise, print "You are a minor".

### Switch
1. Write a JavaScript switch statement that takes a variable `day` representing a day of the week (e.g., 'Monday') and prints "Weekend" if it is Saturday or Sunday, and "Weekday" otherwise.
2. Create a switch statement to check the value of a variable `grade` and print "Excellent" for 'A', "Good" for 'B', "Average" for 'C', "Poor" for 'D', and "Fail" for 'F'.

### Ternary Operator
1. Rewrite the following if-else statement using the ternary operator:
   ```javascript
   if (score > 50) {
       result = "Pass";
   } else {
       result = "Fail";
   }
   ```
2. Use the ternary operator to set a variable `isEven` to true if a number `num` is even, and false if it is odd.

### Break Statement
1. Write a JavaScript for loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10 but breaks the loop when the number 5 is reached.
2. Create a JavaScript while loop that continually prompts the user for a password until the correct password "admin" is entered. Use a break statement to exit the loop when the correct password is entered.

### For Loop
1. Write a JavaScript for loop that prints all even numbers from 1 to 20.
2. Create a for loop that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 and prints the result.

### While Loop
1. Write a JavaScript while loop that prints numbers from 10 down to 1.
2. Create a while loop that prompts the user to enter a number. The loop should continue until the user enters a number greater than 100.

### Do-While Loop
1. Write a JavaScript do-while loop that prints "Hello, World!" five times.
2. Create a do-while loop that asks the user to guess a secret number (e.g., 7). The loop should continue until the user guesses the correct number.

### For-In Loop
1. Given an object `person` with properties `name`, `age`, and `city`, write a for-in loop that prints each property and its value.
2. Create a for-in loop that iterates over an object `car` with properties `make`, `model`, and `year`, and prints each key and value.

### For-Of Loop
1. Write a JavaScript for-of loop that iterates over an array of colors (`['red', 'green', 'blue']`) and prints each color to the console.
2. Create a for-of loop that iterates over a string `str` and prints each character.
